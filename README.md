# Digging-Into-The-Belly-Button-Biome

<p> Using a json file that contains the data of various patients and the bacteria results from their belly button samples, I've created a dynamic and interactive dashbaord that displays the previously mentioned data. By choosing the patient number from the dropdown menu, you can change the information to reflect the findings on the newly selected patient. From the Top 10 Bacteria found, to the number of times they wash/shower per week, it's there. The link to the dashboard is provided below.</p>

<p>1) Before building anything, I needed to examine and import the information. Following the link to the json, I was able to __. Then, using d3.json() to create that constant variable and assigning it as dataSet, I was about to pull and use the information. </p>
